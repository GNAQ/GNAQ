Hi there. I'm GNAQ (read as "G-ko"). This ID is consistently used across various network platforms. Contact me via [GNAQ33@outlook.com](mailto:gnaq33@outlook.com)

I'm majoring in Software Engineering as an undergraduate at Harbin Institute of Technology. Previously, I participated in <ins>competitive programming contests</ins> without achieving notable awards. ([Code Archive](https://github.com/GNAQ/Algorithm-Contest-Archive))

I was once an intern advertisement feature system engineer @Bytedance Ads ML Infra. I used to work for Jisuanke for a very long period as well.

Currently my work focuses on embodied intelligence, robotics-oriented computer vision and deep reinforcement learning. I'm willing to devote my time to learning mathematics and fancy algorithms as well.
