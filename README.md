Hi there. I'm GNAQ (read as "G-ko"). I'm using this ID on almost every network platform. Contact me via [GNAQ33@outlook.com](mailto:gnaq33@outlook.com)

I'm majoring in Software Engineering as an undergraduate at Harbin Institute of Technology. I was once a <ins>competitive programming contestant</ins> ([Code Archive](https://github.com/GNAQ/Algorithm-Contest-Archive) / [35th pl. CCPCWeihai](https://board.xcpcio.com/ccpc/8th/weihai?group=%E6%AD%A3%E5%BC%8F%E9%98%9F%E4%BC%8D)). It's a mixture of feelings for me to say that I didn't get notable awards in these algorithm contests. 

Currently I'm taking part in a Machine Learning Data Platform (MLDP) project as an intern. I'm also trying to get familiar with basic (deep) reinforcement learning methods and its applications.

I'm interested in software infrastructure (particularly machine learning infrastructure), algorithms and reinforcement learning. Feel free to discuss anything with me and please don't hesitate to deliver any feedback!
