Hi there. I'm GNAQ (pronounced "G-ko"), a name I use consistently across various online platforms. Contact me via [GNAQ33@outlook.com](mailto:gnaq33@outlook.com)

I'm majoring in Software Engineering as an undergraduate at Harbin Institute of Technology. Previously, I participated in <ins>competitive programming contests</ins> without achieving notable awards. ([Code Archive](https://github.com/GNAQ/Algorithm-Contest-Archive))

Previously, I interned as an advertisement feature system engineer at Bytedance Ads ML Infra. I used to be a TA for Jisuanke OI education for a very long period as well.

Currently my work focuses on embodied intelligence, robotics-oriented computer vision and deep reinforcement learning. I am also committed to advancing my knowledge in mathematics and sophisticated algorithms.
