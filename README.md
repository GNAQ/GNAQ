Hi there. I'm GNAQ (read as "G-ko"). I'm using this ID on almost every network platform. Contact me via [GNAQ33@outlook.com](mailto:gnaq33@outlook.com)

I'm majoring in Software Engineering as an undergraduate at Harbin Institute of Technology. I was once a <ins>competitive programming contestant</ins> ([Code Archive](https://github.com/GNAQ/Algorithm-Contest-Archive)). It's a mixture of feelings for me to say that I didn't get notable awards in these algorithm contests. 

Currently my work focuses on deep reinforcement learning, its application in robotics and its open-source software infrastructure.

I'm interested in software system, algorithms, machine learning, maths and living a simple life.
