Hi there. I'm GNAQ (often called "G-ko"), a name I use consistently across Internet platforms. Contact: [GNAQ33@outlook.com](mailto:gnaq33@outlook.com)

I am a CS master student at Harbin Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Wangmeng Zuo. I obtained my B.E. in software engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology. Previously, I participated in <ins>competitive programming contests</ins> without achieving notable awards. ([Code Archive](https://github.com/GNAQ/Algorithm-Contest-Archive))

Previously, I interned as an advertisement feature system engineer at Bytedance Ads ML Infra.

Currently my work focuses on embodied intelligence, 3D computer vision and deep reinforcement learning. I am also committed to advancing my knowledge in mathematics and sophisticated algorithms.
