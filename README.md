Hi there. I'm GNAQ (read as "G-ko"). I'm using this ID on almost every network platform. Contact me via [GNAQ33@outlook.com](mailto:gnaq33@outlook.com)

I'm majoring in Software Engineering as an undergraduate at Harbin Institute of Technology. I was once a <ins>competitive programming contestant</ins> ([Code Archive](https://github.com/GNAQ/Algorithm-Contest-Archive)). It's a mixture of feelings for me to say that I didn't get notable awards in these algorithm contests. 

I'm interested in software infrastructure (particularly machine learning infrastructure), algorithms and reinforcement learning. I had an internship as an Ads ML Infra developer at ByteDance Monetization, working on feature processing. Deep reinforcement learning and its application in robotics are my working focus now.

Feel free to discuss anything with me and please don't hesitate to deliver any feedback!

Some little fragments I'm working on: [The Missing Semester - Chinese Version](https://github.com/CN-missemi/CN_missemi) || [A gist of books]() || ...

I have a lot of life interests besides: [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13200045) || [Bangumi](https://bgm.tv/user/gnaq). I also DIY hardware in my spare time.
