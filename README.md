Hello, I am GNAQ from China, you can find me by this ID on various platforms.

Currently I'm majoring CS in Harbin Institute of Technology. I also participate in CCPC & ICPC contests.

I am no good at writing codes, so there's nothing worth to talk about.

Contact me via no1061234176@outlook.com or win1061234176@gmail.com
